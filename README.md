Inlcudes:

Tranzit
  - Tranzit-Richtofen-EE-Two-EMPs (haven't uploaded yet, but by me): 
    * Changes the final step of the easter egg to only require two lamp posts to be EMPed
  - Tranzit-Maxis-EE-Solo, by CCDeroga (https://github.com/CCDeroga/Tranzit-Maxis-EE-Solo):
    * While EMPing the Avogadro under the tower, only one turbine needs to be placed by the nav card table
    * Final step requires only one turbine underneath a lamp post
  - Tranzit-EE-Lightning-Always-at-Cornfield (https://github.com/yaboi-zombies/Tranzit-EE-Lightning-Always-at-Cornfield):
    * Stops the thunderstorm from rotating so that it is always present over the cornfield (does not change when the Avogadro will spawn, but prevents the player from having to wait for the lightning to be overhead before ending each round while waiting for the Avogadro to spawn)
  - NavTables-Always-Built (https://github.com/yaboi-zombies/NavTables-Always-Built):
    * Builds the nav card table for you if not already assembled
    
Die Rise
  - (Solo Maxis) Die-Rise-Maxis-EE-v2.0- by DaddyDontStop (https://github.com/DaddyDontStop/Die-Rise-Maxis-EE-v2.0-):
    * Any elevator symbol will complete the elevator symbol step
    * Number of symbols for the dragon symbol step will scale with the number of players, and does not reset when the wrong symbol is stepped on. Note that there is a correct order to step on the symbols (meaning in solo only one of the four symbols will light up when stepped on)
    * During the orb step any player may pick up the orbs. Trample steams need to be placed at one of the pairs of lion symbols so that the orbs would fling between the two trample steams. Place both orbs on the same trample steam. Place the trample steams down a few times before placing them over the lion symbols. Step can be somewhat glitchy, but you'll know you have the trample steams set up correctly when you cannot pick up another. You may need to pick up and put back the orbs a time or two at the statues as well. Works if you're patient
  - (Solo Richtofen) Highrise Solo by shyperson0 (https://github.com/shyperson0/highrise-solo/releases/tag/v1.0)
    * Any elevator symbol will complete the elevator symbol step
    * Number of symbols for the dragon symbol step will scale with the number of players, and does not reset when the wrong symbol is stepped on. Note that there is a correct order to step on the symbols (meaning in solo only one of the four symbols will light up when stepped on)
    * Zombies can be launched at the tower with any number of trample steams
  - NavTables-Always-Built (https://github.com/yaboi-zombies/NavTables-Always-Built):
    * Builds the nav card table for you if not already assembled
    
Buried
  - (Solo Maxis) Buried-Maxis-EE-Solo by CCDeroga (https://github.com/CCDeroga/Buried-Maxis-EE-Solo)
    * Wisp cant disappear during wisp step and does not need to pass through zombies
    * Bell step doesn't have a timer anymore and will only reset if you fail. Bells must be completed one at a time
    * Sharpshooter autocompletes
  - (Solo Richtofen) Buried Easter Egg QOL V1.0 by Nathan3197 (https://gitlab.com/Nathan3197/stick-gaming-pluto-t6zm-dlc4-ee-patch/-/tree/main)
    * Maze Step: After pulling all four levers for the maze step the game will notify the which ones were correct
    * Sharpshooter: If there are 4 or more players - All targets will need to be shot (just like vanilla)
                    If there are 3 players in the lobby - 61 targets will need to be shot (Saloon + outside the candy store + Myster box area (big guy area 22))
                    If there are 2 players in the lobby - 39 targets will need to be shot (Saloon + outside the candy store (20))
                    If there is 1 player in the lobby - 19 targets will need to be shot (Saloon has 19 targets)
